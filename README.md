LaTeX package files
===================

This repository contains some LaTeX files, I use for a daily basis or for a
specific purpose. License information can be found in each file.

* `luaclassicthesis.sty` is a version of the original classicthesis.sty by Andre
  Miede, changed to work with LuaLaTeX. Some features, e.g. the Minion Pro
  support, have been removed and some other features were added.
